just say something like 

- Hey Alice/Snips
- 40 percent, or set volume to 60 percent or adjust volume to 10 percent etc

Alternatively increase or decrease the volume with 

- Hey Alice/Snips
- raise the volume 5 percent, or decrease volume by 20 percent etc

#SETUP

In the pi's terminal type 

 - ```aplay -l```
 
   and see what your card number is. Then select that from the drop list in the skill settings

EG: respeaker 2 is likely card 1 
   
 NOTE: if you choose nothing it will default to card0

Please discuss in discord any additions you find that need added.
